# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to understand and apply fundamental concepts of HTML, as well as the git workflow.

I used basic principles learned in The Odin Project to make a simple html-only website. The homepage has an unordered list of recipes. Each recipe directs to a different .html file that contains a heading, an image, a description, and two lists (one ordered and one unordered). I also added the option to head back to homepage from each recipe page.

The recipes and images on the project were take by allrecipes.com, and the poutine image was taken by seriouseats.com.
